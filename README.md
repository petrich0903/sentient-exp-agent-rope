# Experimental Agent: Expanding RoPE Methodologies on the Sentient GRID

## Overview

This project explores how **Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE)** - originally designed for Transformers - can be expanded beyond token-level context to **multi-agent cognitive alignment** within the **SentientAGI GRID**.

The goal is to design an **experimental agent architecture** where context, memory, and relational awareness between distributed nodes follow RoPE-inspired rotational dynamics. In essence, this experiment treats "position" not just as spatial or sequential, but as *cognitive state orientation* across a living agent network.
## Motivation


In the RoFormer paper (Su et al., 2023), RoPE introduces rotation-based positional encoding that preserves **relative position information** and **contextual decay** efficiently in Transformer models. This project hypothesizes that similar rotational
dynamics could apply to **Sentient's GRID-based AGI systems**, enabling:

**Stable long-context reasoning** across agents

**Relational awareness** between distributed cognitive

units

**Reduced information loss** when agents "pass thought states" or memories

## Experimental Objectives

1. Model **agent states** as rotary-encoded vectors in shared latent space.

2.

Simulate **context transfer** across Sentient GRID nodes using RoPE-like transformations.

Observe if rotary embeddings can stabilize multi-agent awareness or synchronization.

4.

Document findings for integration with **SentientAGI's open research layer**.
